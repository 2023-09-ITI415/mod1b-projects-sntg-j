# Module1-Projects
 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1

 Goals of the Project:
    I first intended to create a procedurally generated game that would have the player run through an obstacle course with the UI checking there score. 
    
    This was going to be including the mechanics of roll-a-ball and the random generation of the ApplePicker game. This however was a little too ambitious for the current timeframe and schedule I had.

    Instead I decided to make a simple, and challenging game that would still be complicated to set up as a developer and tricky for the players who are playing the game for the first time.

    As part of the framework I decided to follow the MDA model which had been a guideline for much of the games I have been working on. At a first glance, the players would see a new addition to the game that would make them question the new addition of the obstacle. The mechanics have been kept the same since the first version of roll-a-ball, however, I added a new goal of avoiding the spikes that would first rotate along with the collectibles and as the players progress in the game will be caught off guard by the exansion and reduction of the radius of items in the GameArea. This gives the players incentive to focus on avoiding and timing the pulses and acquiring the collectibles to win the game or potentially lose if the player loses enough health before completing the game.
